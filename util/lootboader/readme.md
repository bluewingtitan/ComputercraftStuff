# LootBoader

This Program will write another Program onto a Pocket-Computer as "startup" => automatically starting it with the computer.

=> This enables full on custom firmware, since the Ctrl+T Key Combination can be ignored by starting a lua program with the lines "os.pullEvent = os.pullEventRaw", and a reboot will just result in a restart of the main program.
You could (for example) sell single-purpouse devices to your friends, and make them buy new ones once an update arrives.
Sounds evil? Well it is, but capitalism in video games is fun as long as you are making bank with it, so I will present you with the solution.
