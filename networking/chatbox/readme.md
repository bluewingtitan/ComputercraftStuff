# Chatbox > CC-Chat Program

Design: A single Server is running, Clients communicate via the server.

The Program is designed to be distributed via a Floppy Disk.

I will also write a program loading another program (the client in this case) as "startup" (automatically starting it on startup) on a pocket computer once one get's inserted into a floppy drive, to enable easy distribution on Pocket-Hardware.
